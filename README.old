Description
===========

Qucsator is a command line driven circuit simulator.  It takes a network list
in a certain format as input and outputs a Qucs dataset.  It has been
programmed for usage in the Qucs project but can also be used by other
applications.

Requirements
============

Adms is required to translate some component parts. Tested with 2.3.6.

Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf qucsator-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucsator-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)

Change into the source directory:

    $ cd qucsator-<version>

Configure the source package for your system:

    $ ./configure

Now compile the package. Note that parallel build is broken at the moment.

    $ make

Install Qucsator. This is optional.

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable
by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in this distribution.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

Getting the latest development version
======================================

You can always get the current Qucsator version from our repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/Qucs/qucsator
    $ cd qucsator

Run `sh bootstrap' before `configure' with the appropriate options.
